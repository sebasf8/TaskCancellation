# taskCancellation
Project were we explore different ways to cancel tasks in SwiftUI due to user interactions

For example if you have pressed a button to filter "Action" movies but you changed your idea and you want to watch "Thriller" movies instead.

Check my last post of what you should consider when user input can fire asynchronous operations in SwiftUI and how you can relay on the power of task modifier in SwiftUI to accomplish it!
